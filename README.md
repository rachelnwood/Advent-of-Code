# Advent of Code Programs 
Python Solutions by Rachel Wood

## Goals & Approach
This portfolio of Advent of Code is to document my growth as I learn Python.

### Goals:
- Practice breaking down problem statements into granular, solvable problems.
- Use tests to speed up development and ensure correctness.

### Approach:
- Develop a clear approach.
- Add tessts for known examples and edge cases.
- Refactor for readability and performance.

## Repository Structure
```

├── Day#/
│ ├── README.md

│ ├── part02_solution.py
│ ├── part02_tests.py

│ └── sample_input
```
## Running a Solution
Each day's parts can be run independently.

```bash
python3 2025/day7/part02_solution.py
```

### Testing Strategy
- All tests are written using 'pytest'
- Validation against AoC example inputs
- Unit tests for core logic, helper functions, and edge case

## Skills Demonstrated
- Test-driven development
- Object-oriented programming
- Recursive functions
- Python type hints
- Parsing structured input
