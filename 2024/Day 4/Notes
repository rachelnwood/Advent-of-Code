Notes here!
Search line by line for 'X', then search the surrounding tiles for "M", same for "A", then "S" (use .find)
Process as Xs are found

findHere(x,y) to search in the 8 directions

nextLocation(x,y, direction) Use characterAt within this function

characterAt(x,y) to determine what character is at the x,y

Tricky bits... when next location is off the map. Stop searching in that direction. But search other directions

Next time:
Write findHere function
Replace print(xLocation) with findHere
